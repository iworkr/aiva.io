globs: supabase/migrations/**/*.sql
---
You are an expert full-stack developer specializing in Next.js 15, Supabase, and TypeScript, with deep knowledge of database design patterns and type safety.

Core Responsibilities:

1. Check for mcp Tool:

Always query the local_db tool (mcp tool) first to check if it is available.

If the mcp tool is not found, notify the user:
"No mcp tool found. Falling back to migration files for database changes."

If the mcp tool is found, use it only for read operations (e.g., SELECT queries) to gather current database information. Never use it to write directly to the database.

2. Supabase Project Configuration:

**Aiva.io Supabase Project**:
- **Project Reference**: `lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog`
- **Project URL**: `https://lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog.supabase.co`
- **Database Password**: `8XC7lkl75hKzCOzY` (use when linking)
- **Publishable Key**: `sb_publishable_FQasu83EL-o4aHeeVu_QZQ_-hcGyVBy`
- **Secret Key**: `sb_secret_xFWpLbcgb5bw81OV5BnDSw_Ss9dewCc`
- **JWT Secret**: `lTCOKL7LIn7p/5dhlkHzc9k6Hhga1ctC97c59eTaCax/DirFXerKnwjtTAajzmytKAEzk0xB7aIEeB2Z8qqRLQ==`

**API Settings**:
- **Exposed schemas**: `public`, `graphql_public`
- **Extra search path**: `public`, `extensions`
- **Max rows**: `1000`
- **Pool size**: Configured automatically based on compute size

Always ensure the project is linked before pushing migrations:
```bash
supabase link --project-ref lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog
```
When prompted for password, use: `8XC7lkl75hKzCOzY`

2. Migration File Creation:

Always implement database changes via migration files.

Follow the migration file naming guidelines strictly:

Format: YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql (use the current date and time for the timestamp). Always get the current date and time from the user's terminal by running a command.

Description: Use a clear, descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the migration (e.g., create_workspace_domain.sql, add_workspace_settings.sql).

Group related changes into a single migration file.

Include rollback scripts (down migrations) for every migration file.

3. Migration Deployment:

After creating a migration file, ALWAYS push it to Supabase:

Step 1: Ensure project is linked (if not already linked):
```bash
supabase link --project-ref lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog
```

Step 2: Push migrations to Supabase:
```bash
supabase db push
```

This will apply all pending migrations to the remote Supabase database.

IMPORTANT: Never skip the push step. All migrations must be applied to Supabase after creation.

If linking fails, use the database password when prompted: 8XC7lkl75hKzCOzY 

4. Database Design Principles:

Follow the database design principles outlined below strictly.

Ensure all changes are type-safe, well-documented, and backward-compatible.

Technical Stack Versions:
- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- Supabase v2

5. Migration Deployment Workflow:

When creating a migration, follow this complete workflow:

1. **Create Migration**:
   ```bash
   supabase migration new descriptive_migration_name
   ```
   This creates a new file: `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_migration_name.sql`

2. **Write Migration SQL**:
   - Write the migration SQL in the created file
   - Include both UP and DOWN migrations if needed
   - Follow database design principles below

3. **Link Project** (if not already linked):
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog
   ```
   Use password `8XC7lkl75hKzCOzY` if prompted

4. **Push Migration to Supabase**:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   This applies all pending migrations to the remote database.

5. **Verify Migration**:
   - Check Supabase dashboard → Database → Migrations
   - Verify the migration appears and is applied
   - Test the changes in the database

6. **Regenerate Types**:
   ```bash
   pnpm generate:types
   ```
   This updates TypeScript types from the database schema.

7. **Update Application Code**:
   - Update any code that uses the changed schema
   - Update Zod schemas if needed
   - Test the changes

**CRITICAL: Never skip step 4 (pushing migrations). All migrations MUST be pushed to Supabase immediately after creation.**

**Migration Push Workflow** (MANDATORY):
1. After creating migration file, immediately run:
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref lgyewlqzelxkpawnmiog
   ```
   (Use password `8XC7lkl75hKzCOzY` if prompted)

2. Push migrations to Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

3. Verify migration was applied:
   - Check Supabase Dashboard → Database → Migrations
   - Confirm migration appears and shows as applied
   - Test the changes in Supabase SQL Editor

4. Regenerate TypeScript types:
   ```bash
   pnpm generate:types
   ```

**Never commit migrations without pushing them first. Always push → verify → regenerate types → commit.**



1. Table Naming:
- Use snake_case for all database objects
- Prefix tables by domain (e.g., billing_*, user_*, workspace_*)
- Use plural form for table names (users, not user)
- Junction tables should combine both table names (e.g., marketing_blog_author_posts)

2. Column Conventions:
- Primary keys: Always named 'id' of type UUID with uuid_generate_v4() default
- Foreign keys: Suffix with _id (e.g., user_id, workspace_id)
- Timestamps: created_at, updated_at with TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
- Soft deletes: deleted_at nullable timestamp
- Boolean flags: Prefix with 'is_' (e.g., is_active, is_deleted)
- JSON columns: Suffix with _data or _settings (e.g., metadata, workspace_settings)
- Enums: Suffix type with appropriate categorization (_status, _type, _role)

3. Type Definitions:
- NEVER use 'text' for predefined options - use ENUM types
- Use precise numeric types (e.g., numeric(12,2) for currency)
- Prefer non-nullable columns with appropriate defaults
- Use UUID for all IDs and relations
- JSON columns must be JSONB type for better performance
- Use timestamptz (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE) for all timestamps

4. Row Level Security (RLS):
- Enable RLS on ALL tables
- Define policies using function-based expressions
- Standard policies:
  - check if user is workspace member for workspace resources. Read supabase/migration files for reference on how we already do that. 
  - auth.uid() for user-specific resources
  - service_role only for admin operations
  - Don't invent new patterns. Use existing patterns as much as possible.
  - We have utility functions such as is_workspace_member, is_workspace_admin for easy use. Don't recreate them. 

5. Indexing Strategy:
- Index all foreign key columns
- Create unique indexes on natural keys (e.g., slugs, emails)
- Add composite indexes for common query patterns
- Index jsonb columns using GIN for search
- Add indexes on frequently filtered columns

6. Schema Organization:
- Group related tables by domain prefix
- Use schema migrations for all changes
- Document all enum types
- Maintain referential integrity with foreign keys



### Best Practices for Migrations

1. **Naming Conventions**:
   - Prefix with timestamp of current date and time (not arbitrary date and time): `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_description.sql`
   - Use descriptive names: `create_workspace_domain.sql`
   - Group related changes in single migration

2. **Migration Workflow**:
   - Create migration file: `supabase migration new migration_name`
   - Write migration SQL in the created file
   - Test locally (if using local Supabase): `supabase migration up`
   - Push to remote Supabase: `supabase db push`
   - Verify migration applied: Check Supabase dashboard
   - Generate types: `pnpm generate:types`

3. **Safety Measures**:
   - Always test migrations on development first
   - Include rollback scripts (down migrations)
   - Take database snapshots before major migrations
   - Consider data migration impact
   - Verify migrations are pushed to Supabase

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Create indexes after bulk data operations
   - Use concurrent index creation for production
   - Consider migration impact on large tables
   - Add appropriate timeouts for long-running migrations

5. **Version Control**:
   - Commit migrations separately from application code
   - Never modify existing migration files
   - Document breaking changes in migration files
   - Include seed data in separate files
   - Ensure migrations are pushed before committing

6. **Testing**:
   - Test both up and down migrations
   - Verify RLS policies after migration
   - Check foreign key constraints
   - Validate enum values and check constraints
   - Verify migration in Supabase dashboard

7. **Deployment Checklist**:
   - [ ] Migration file created with correct naming
   - [ ] Migration SQL written and tested locally (if applicable)
   - [ ] Migration pushed to Supabase: `supabase db push`
   - [ ] Migration verified in Supabase dashboard
   - [ ] Types regenerated: `pnpm generate:types`
   - [ ] Application code updated to use new schema
   - [ ] RLS policies tested
   - [ ] Migration committed to version control
