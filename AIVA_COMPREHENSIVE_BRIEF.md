# Aiva.io - Comprehensive Non-Technical Brief

## What is Aiva.io?

**Aiva.io** is an AI-powered virtual assistant that acts as your personal communication manager. Think of it as having a smart assistant that watches all your messages across email, messaging apps, and social media, then helps you respond faster, stay organized, and never miss important conversations.

Instead of switching between Gmail, Outlook, Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other apps throughout your day, Aiva brings everything into one unified dashboard. It uses artificial intelligence to understand what messages matter most, draft replies for you, extract tasks, manage your calendar, and even send routine responses automatically when it's confident it's doing the right thing.

## The Core Problem Aiva Solves

Most professionals today are drowning in communication overload:

- **Multiple inboxes**: Gmail, Outlook, Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram DMs, LinkedIn messages, Teams chats
- **Constant switching**: Jumping between apps to check messages, losing context and time
- **Missed opportunities**: Important messages get buried in noise
- **Time drain**: Spending hours each day reading, prioritizing, and responding to messages
- **Scheduling chaos**: Double-booked meetings, missed appointments, no time for deep work
- **Task overload**: Promises made in messages get forgotten, follow-ups slip through cracks

**Aiva solves all of this** by becoming your single command center for communication and scheduling.

## What Aiva Does

### 1. Unified Inbox - One Place for Everything

Aiva connects to all your communication channels and brings every message into one dashboard. Whether someone emails you on Gmail, messages you on Slack, sends a WhatsApp, or reaches out on LinkedIn, you see it all in one place.

**How it works:**
- You connect your accounts (Gmail, Outlook, Slack, etc.) through secure OAuth login
- Aiva syncs messages from all channels automatically
- Everything appears in your unified inbox, organized chronologically
- You can filter by channel, priority, or status to find what you need instantly

**What you see:**
- All messages from all channels in one list
- Visual badges showing which channel each message came from
- AI-generated priority indicators (High, Medium, Low, Noise)
- Category tags (Customer Inquiry, Sales Lead, Support Request, etc.)
- Sentiment indicators (Positive, Neutral, Negative, Urgent)
- Unread counts and statistics

### 2. AI-Powered Message Intelligence

Aiva doesn't just show you messages—it understands them. Using advanced AI, Aiva analyzes every message to help you prioritize and respond effectively.

**Classification & Prioritization:**
- **Priority Detection**: Aiva automatically determines if a message is urgent, important, routine, or just noise
- **Category Classification**: Identifies whether it's a customer inquiry, sales lead, support request, marketing email, personal message, or something else
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understands if the sender is happy, frustrated, neutral, or urgent
- **Actionability Scoring**: Determines if the message needs a response, contains a question, is just informational, or requires scheduling

**How it helps:**
- You immediately see which messages need your attention first
- Low-priority marketing emails and spam are automatically filtered
- Important customer inquiries and sales leads are highlighted
- You spend less time sorting through noise and more time on what matters

### 3. Smart Reply Generation

Aiva can draft replies for you, saving hours of typing. It understands context, learns your communication style, and generates appropriate responses.

**How it works:**
- Click "AI Draft" on any message
- Aiva analyzes the message content, conversation history, and your preferences
- Generates a reply draft in your tone (formal, casual, friendly, or professional)
- You can edit the draft before sending, or send it as-is
- Aiva shows a confidence score indicating how certain it is about the reply quality

**Features:**
- **Context-Aware**: Understands the full conversation thread, even across different channels
- **Tone Matching**: Adapts to your writing style and the relationship with the sender
- **Multiple Options**: Generate short replies, detailed responses, or friendly variations
- **Editable**: Always review and edit before sending—you're in control
- **Confidence Scoring**: See how confident Aiva is (higher scores mean more reliable drafts)

**Example scenarios:**
- Customer asks "Where's my order?" → Aiva drafts a professional response checking order status
- Colleague asks "Can we meet tomorrow?" → Aiva drafts a friendly confirmation or proposes alternative times
- Lead asks about pricing → Aiva drafts a sales-focused response with next steps

### 4. Automatic Task Extraction

Aiva reads through your messages and automatically identifies tasks and action items, so nothing falls through the cracks.

**How it works:**
- Aiva scans messages for phrases like "please send," "can you," "let's schedule," "follow up"
- Extracts the task, due date (if mentioned), and priority
- Creates tasks automatically in your task list
- Sends reminders before deadlines

**What gets extracted:**
- "Can you send me the report by Friday?" → Task: "Send report" Due: Friday
- "Let's revisit this next week" → Reminder task for next week
- "Please review the contract" → Task: "Review contract"
- "Schedule a meeting with the team" → Task + scheduling intent detected

**Task Management:**
- View all tasks in one place
- Filter by status (Pending, Completed)
- See statistics (total tasks, completed, overdue)
- Mark tasks complete with one click
- Tasks are linked back to the original message for context

### 5. Intelligent Scheduling & Calendar Management

Aiva manages your calendar intelligently, preventing double-bookings and helping you schedule meetings automatically.

**Calendar Integration:**
- Connects to Google Calendar and Outlook Calendar
- Sees all your events, meetings, and blocked time
- Understands your availability and working hours
- Respects time zones and travel time

**Scheduling from Messages:**
- When someone asks "Can we meet tomorrow?" Aiva detects the scheduling intent
- Checks your calendar for availability
- Suggests available time slots
- Can automatically create calendar events and send invites
- Prevents double-bookings and conflicts

**Conflict Management:**

**Smart Features:**

### 6. Auto-Send (When Safe)

For routine, low-risk messages, Aiva can send replies automatically without you having to review them first.

**How it works:**
- Aiva generates a reply draft
- Calculates a confidence score (how certain it is the reply is appropriate)
- If confidence is high enough AND the message type is safe (acknowledgments, confirmations, simple responses), Aiva can send automatically
- You set the confidence threshold—higher threshold = more conservative auto-sending

**Safety Features:**
- **Confidence Thresholds**: You control how confident Aiva must be before auto-sending
- **Message Type Rules**: Only certain types of messages can be auto-sent (simple acknowledgments, confirmations)
- **Sender Whitelist/Blacklist**: Specify which contacts Aiva can auto-reply to
- **Audit Log**: Every auto-sent message is logged so you can review what was sent
- **Kill Switch**: Instantly pause all auto-sending with one button
- **Rollback**: If something goes wrong, you can undo auto-sent messages

**What gets auto-sent:**
- "Thank you for your email, I'll get back to you soon"
- "Meeting confirmed for tomorrow at 2pm"
- "Received, will review and respond"
- Simple acknowledgments and confirmations

**What never gets auto-sent:**
- Responses to complaints or sensitive topics
- Sales leads or important business inquiries
- Messages requiring nuanced judgment
- Anything with low confidence scores

### 7. Cross-Channel Context & Relationship Mapping

Aiva understands relationships across different platforms. If someone emails you, then messages you on LinkedIn, then sends a WhatsApp, Aiva connects the dots.

**How it works:**
- Aiva tracks all interactions with each contact across all channels
- Shows you conversation history even if it spans multiple platforms
- Understands context: "Last contact: LinkedIn on Monday, now emailing you"
- Maps relationships: identifies clients, leads, colleagues, personal contacts

**Benefits:**

- See the full relationship history with any contact
- Understand the bigger picture of your communications

**What you get:**

- Overdue responses and tasks
- Summary of yesterday's activity
- Upcoming deadlines and reminders

**How it helps:**
- Know immediately what needs your attention
- Never miss important messages or meetings
- Plan your day more effectively
- Stay on top of commitments

### 9. Search & Memory

**Universal Search:**

- Filter by channel, date range, contact, sentiment, priority
- Find conversations even if you don't remember which channel they were on

**Smart Queries:**
- "Show me all emails from Sarah about contract revisions"

**Cross-Channel Memory:**
